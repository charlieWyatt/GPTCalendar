# What is it

This project consists of multiple files that together form a system for organizing events using a Google Calendar. The system includes a decorator function called "openaifunc" that collects information about the parameters of decorated functions, a script called "Calendar.py" that allows interaction with a Google Calendar, and a chatbot script called "GPTCalendar.py" that utilizes the functionalities of the Calendar script to organize events through a conversational interface.

# Requirements

To run this system, the following requirements must be met:

1. Python: The system is written in Python programming language, so Python must be installed on the system. It is recommended to use Python version 3.7 or above.

2. Google Calendar API credentials: To interact with a Google Calendar, API credentials must be obtained. This involves creating a project in the Google Cloud Console, enabling the Google Calendar API, and generating credentials. The credentials file path must be specified in the configuration file.

3. Required libraries: The system relies on several Python libraries, which must be installed. The required libraries can be installed by running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the command line.

# How to run it

Follow the steps below to run the system:

1. Obtain Google Calendar API credentials: Create a project in the Google Cloud Console, enable the Google Calendar API, and generate API credentials. Save the credentials file in a secure location.

2. Install Python: If Python is not already installed, download and install the latest version of Python from the official Python website.

3. Clone the project: Clone the project repository from the provided source.

4. Install the required libraries: Navigate to the project directory and run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required libraries.

5. Update configuration settings: Open the `configs/config.py` file and update the following settings:
   - `CREDENTIALS_FILE_PATH`: Set this to the path of the Google Calendar API credentials file obtained in step 1.
   - `TIMEZONE`: Set this to the desired timezone for the calendar.
   - `USERNAME`: Set this to the desired username for the chatbot.

6. Run the Calendar script: Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory. Run the command `python Calendar.py` to start the Calendar script.

7. Run the GPTCalendar script: Open another terminal and navigate to the project directory. Run the command `python GPTCalendar.py` to start the GPTCalendar chatbot.

8. Interact with the chatbot: Once the GPTCalendar script is running, you can interact with the chatbot by entering prompts and messages. Follow the on-screen instructions to organize events and perform other actions.

# Examples

Example 1: Checking Calendar Availability

```
User: Check my calendar availability from tomorrow to next week.
Chatbot: You have an event scheduled from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM tomorrow. Otherwise, you're free.
```

Example 2: Booking an Event

```
User: Book a meeting on Friday at 2:00 PM for one hour.
Chatbot: Sure, I have booked a meeting for you on Friday from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM. Anything else I can help with?
```

Example 3: Updating an Event

```
User: Update the meeting on Friday to 3:30 PM.
Chatbot: The meeting has been updated to start at 3:30 PM. Anything else I can help with?
```

Example 4: Deleting an Event

```
User: Delete the meeting on Friday.
Chatbot: The meeting on Friday has been deleted. Anything else I can help with?
```

Note: These are just examples to illustrate the usage of the system. The actual prompts and messages may vary depending on the conversation with the chatbot.

---

In summary, this system provides a way to organize events using a Google Calendar through a decorator function, a Calendar script, and a GPTCalendar chatbot script. It requires Python, Google Calendar API credentials, and several Python libraries to run. The steps to run the system are outlined above, and example interactions with the chatbot are provided as well.
